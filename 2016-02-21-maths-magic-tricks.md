I'm going to try my best to explain some maths tricks starting with some pretty simple ideas for which you can try yourself on firends and family. These are not new nor created by me but are centuries old trick.  

1. How to guess **how much money** someone has in their wallet/purse or pocket.
2. **Magic Squares** - Simply to difficult.
3. How to work out the **day or the week** for any given date in history or the future.
4. Easy **Square Roots**
5. **Vedic** Maths.
6. Some fun **Fibonacci** facts and **The Golden Ratio**.

1. How to guess **how much money** someone has on them. Just guessing either dollars only or cents only.
STEPS - Ask person to do these steps
   1.       Ask them to take the amount he they in his pocket or wallet/purse, count it and remember the number.
   2.       Ask them to add 5 to the number.
   3.       Ask them to multiply by 5 the answer from step 2 .
   4.       Ask them to to double the answer from step 3.
   5.       Ask them to add any one digit number from 0 to 9 to the result from step 4.
   6.       Ask them to add 10 to the result from step 5.
   After the steps are over ask them to tell you the final answer.

ADDITIONAL STEPS - To be done by you
    ·      Ignore the digit in the unit’s place from the answer given.
    ·      From the remaining number, subtract 6 and you will come to know the amount of money they have.

EXAMPLE
Let us suppose a person has $23 on them. The steps are given below:
    1.      Take the amount in your wallet        = 23
    2.      Add 5                                 = 28
    3.      Multiply by 5                         = 140
    4.      Double the answer                     = 280
    5.      Add a single digit number (say, 7)    = 287
    6.      Add 10                                = 297

The final answer would have been 297.
Ignore the digit in the unit’s place (in this case it is 7). Now the remaining number is 29.
From 29, we subtract 6 to get 23.
The our answer is **$23**.

Another quick EXAMPLE
Assume money is $48
48 + 5 = 53 X 5 = 265 X 2 = 530 + 3 = 533 + 10 = 543, remove 3 = 54 - 6 = **48**!

2. **Magic Squares** To Follow

EXAMPLE


4.  Easy **Square Roots** for any 2 digit Numbers x^2
EXAMPLE
17^2 - Round number up or down to closest 10
so 17^2 would round up to 20 which is a count of 3.
So calculation is 17 + 3 = 20 X 17 - 3 = 14
Read as 20 X 14 = 280
Now add count^2 which is 3^2 = 9
So 280 + 9 = **289**

ANOTHER EXAMPLE
63^2
Round down to 60 meaning a count of 3
So 63 - 3 = 60 X 63 + 3 = 66
Read as 60 X 66 = 3960
Add 3^2 = 9
So 3600 + 9 = **3969**

5. **Vedic** Maths - To Follow

6. **Fibonacci** Fun Facts and **The Golden Ratio**

Fibonacci numbers are those where the following number in a sequence is added to the previous number to get the next number usually read using the following mathematical formula.
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

EXAMPLE
1 1 2 3 5 8 13  21  34  55  89

1 + 1 + 4 = 6 which = 2 X 3
1 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 15 which + 3 X 5
1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 = 40 which = 5 X 8
1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 25 + 64 = 104 which = 8 X 13 which is 1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 8^2 = 8 X 13

These sequences can be represented as a box of squares/rectanlges
Once drawn as boxes you can get the area using the same as above 1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 8^2 = 8 X 13
or height X length, 13 = 8 + 5

Another way to look at the same sequence
8 X 13  = 13 / 8  = 1.625
13 X 21 = 21 / 13 = 1.615
21 X 34 = 34 / 21 = 1.619
34 X 55 = 55 / 34 = 1.6176
55 X 89 = 89 / 55 = 1.61818

This is showing the **Golden Ration** known as 1.618033
